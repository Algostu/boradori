## 3.2 Exercise

# 1
S = stack (initial capacity = 1)
array doubling is applied
maximum number of elements is `2^k + 1` 
How much memory is needed to run this program successfully?
`2^(k+1)`

# 2
Prove the total time of invocations of push is `O(n)` where n is the number of pushes to the stack.
Assume `C = 3, 3^k < n`, time complexity for `stackFull()` is `O(new_capacity)`. So total time of `stackFull()` is `Sigma(3^i) i = 1 to k+1`. The number of call of `push()` is n, which is similar to `Sigma(3^i) i = 1 to k+1`. As a result, the total time of invocations of push is `O(n)`

# 3
`O(n + sigma((c+1) ^ i) i = 0 to k+1)` is `O(n)`
